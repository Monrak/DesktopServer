## 🏗️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- .NET 9.0 Runtime

### ⚠️ Build Requirements: Binary Dependencies

Due to GitHub's **100MB file size limit** and for repository performance, the large binary stacks (Apache, MySQL, PHP, etc.) are **not included** in this repository. These files must be manually placed in the `Resources` folder of the respective versions to successfully build the installer.

Developers must provide the following files:

| Target Folder | Required Files |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Lite/DesktopServerSetup/Resources/`** | `apache24_tmp.zip`, `mysql80_tmp.zip`, `php74.zip`, `pma_tmp.zip`, `DesktopServerManager.exe`* |
| **`Pro/DesktopServerSetupPro/Resources/`** | `apache24_tmp.zip`, `mysql80_tmp.zip`, `php56.zip`, `php74.zip`, `php82.zip`, `pma56_tmp.zip`, `pma_tmp.zip`, `vcredist_x64.exe`, `DesktopServerManagerPro.exe`* |

*\* Note: The `.exe` files for the Manager can be generated by building the Manager project or running the build scripts.*

### Development / Building from Source
To build the project from source, you need **Visual Studio 2022** and the **.NET 9.0 SDK**.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `DesktopServer.sln` in the root (for everything) or individual solutions in `Lite/` and `Pro/`.
3. Build the solution in `Release` mode.
4. Alternatively, use the provided PowerShell scripts:
   ```powershell
   # Build everything (Recommended)
   .\build_all.ps1

   # Build Lite version
   cd Lite
   .\build.ps1
   ```

### Build Pipeline & Publishing

DesktopServer uses a two-stage build process to create a self-contained installer:

1.  **Manager Application**: The `DesktopServerManager` (the main UI) is published as a single-file executable.
2.  **Setup Project**: The published manager `.exe` is then copied into the `Setup/Resources` folder of the respective version.
3.  **Installer Bundle**: The setup project is built, bundling the manager and all necessary server assets into a single installer.

### Output Locations

Depending on how you build, the final artifacts are organized as follows:

- **Using PowerShell Scripts (Recommended)**:
  - **Master Build** (`.\build_all.ps1`):
    - Final Artifacts Folder: `.\Deploy\`
    - Files Included:
      - `DesktopServerSetupLite.exe`, `.zip`, `.7z`
      - `DesktopServerSetupPro.exe`, `.zip`, `.7z`
  - **Individual Build** (e.g., `.\Lite\build.ps1`):
    - Artifacts: `.\Lite\Publish\`

---

### 📦 Publishing for Users

To create clean, ready-to-distribute installers and archives:
1. Open PowerShell in the root directory.
2. Run `.\build_all.ps1`.
3. All distribution-ready files will be available in the **`.\Deploy`** folder. These include both `.exe` installers and compressed `.zip` / `.7z` versions.
